## Working on issues

We consider all issues not assigned to anybody as available for contributors. The **[help wanted](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/labels/help%20wanted)** label is used to single out issues that we consider easier or higher priority on list of things that we would like to see.

## Pull requests

We don't require that pull requests to be followed with bug reports. If you've found typo or silly little bug that has no issue or pull request already, you can open your own pull request. We only ask that this PR provides context or explanation for what problem it fixes or which are of project it improves.
